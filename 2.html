  <h2>Kinetics란 무엇인가?</h2>
    <p>
      In physics and engineering, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetics_(physics)" target="blank">kinetcis</a> is the branch of classical mechanics that is concerned with the relationship between motion and its causes, specifically, forces and torques. Since the mid-20th century, the term "dynamics" (or "analytical dynamics") has largely superseded "kinetics" in physics textbooks, though the term is still used in engineering.
