      안녕하세요. 저는 <strong>문영찬</strong>이라고 합니다. 앞으로 잘 부탁드려요.
      Hello. My name is <u><strong>Yeong-chan Mun</strong></u>. Nice to meet you.

      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemistry" target="blank">Chemistry</a> is the scientific discipline involved with elements and compounds composed of atoms, molecules and ions: their composition, structure, properties, behavior and the changes they undergo during a reaction with other substances. In the scope of its subject, chemistry occupies an intermediate position between physics and biology. It is sometimes called the central science because it provides a foundation for understanding both basic and applied scientific disciplines at a fundamental level. For example, chemistry explains aspects of plant chemistry (botany), the formation of igneous rocks (geology), how atmospheric ozone is formed and how environmental pollutants are degraded (ecology), the properties of the soil on the moon (astrophysics), how medications work (pharmacology), and how to collect DNA evidence at a crime scene (forensics).
